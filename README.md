## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

### 1. Claim Rate by Age Group
![Claim Rate by Age](images/claim_by_age.png)  
ðŸ“Œ **Insight**: Younger and older age groups (especially 16â€“25 ) show higher claim rates.

### 2. Claim Rate by Driving Experience
![Claim Rate by Experience](images/claim_by_experience.png)  
ðŸ“Œ **Insight**: Drivers with 0â€“9 years of experience are more likely to file claims. Experience strongly correlates with lower risk.

### 3. PCA 3D Plot
![3D PCA Plot](images/pca_3d.png)  
ðŸ“Œ **Insight**: PCA reveals separability in clusters. The model likely finds distinct patterns between those who file claims and those who donâ€™t.

### 4. SHAP Summary Plot (Real Results)
![SHAP Summary Plot](images/shap_summary.png)  
ðŸ“Œ **Insight**: Features like `DRIVING_EXPERIENCE_0-9y`, `VEHICLE_YEAR_before 2015`, and `CREDIT_SCORE` strongly influence predictions. SHAP values confirm feature importance rankings.

### 5. Neural Network Training Accuracy (Real Results)
![Training History](images/nn_accuracy_plot.png)  
ðŸ“Œ **Insight**: Model trains well and generalizes reasonably with early stopping. Minor fluctuations are due to dropout and validation split variation.
